    "## Trajectoryless Analysis Workshop Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're running a sample simulation of \n",
    "a protein ([1HEL](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1hel)) in water and analyzing it with live simulation streaming implemented in GROMACS and MDAnalysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work up from the most basic IMDClient usage to a complex, live visualization of the simulation,\n",
    "ending with a challenge to implement your own trajectoryless analysis code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Starting the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the simulation, first run the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd activity\n",
    "# Preprocess the topology and run the simulation\n",
    "./run.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, when you see the following line printed to the terminal, \n",
    "the simulation is ready for an IMD connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "`IMD: Will wait until I have a connection and IMD_GO orders.`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Running analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Each analysis cell below connects to the running simulation and attempts to\n",
    "analyze the entire trajectory. However, you can interrupt the cell at any time\n",
    "for it to disconnect from the simulation so that another cell can be run.\n",
    "Just press the interrupt button on the cell or on the jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Stopping the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to stop the simulation and restart it, you can also run CTRL+C in the terminal to stop the simulation entirely. The imd client will automatically determine that the stream is over and continue execution outside of the analysis loop.\n",
